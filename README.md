# Stack_Queue_data_structures

This repository contains implementations in C of multiple data structures used at EFREI.

This code is provided for educational purpose only.

How does it work ?

Stack : SSL (Simple Linked List) and Arrays => Stack and unstack at the beginning of the stack.

Queue : (HT_L) Head & Tail List => Enqueue at the beginning and dequeue at the end of the queue.
